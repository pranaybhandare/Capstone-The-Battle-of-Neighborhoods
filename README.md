# Capstone-The-Battle-of-Neighborhoods
Now that you have been equipped with the skills and the tools to use location data to explore a geographical location, over the course of two weeks, you will have the opportunity to be as creative as you want and come up with an idea to leverage the Foursquare location data to explore or compare neighborhoods or cities of your choice or to come up with a problem that you can use the Foursquare location data to solve.

#  Introduction/Business Problem 
Clearly define a problem or an idea of your choice, where you would need to leverage the Foursquare location data to solve or execute. Remember that data science problems always target an audience and are meant to help a group of stakeholders solve a problem, so make sure that you explicitly describe your audience and why they would care about your problem.

**The idea of this study is to help people planning vacations in NYC to choose an Airbnb listing based on a criterion of preferences for entertainment, food and other factors. I will analyze Manhattan listings to  recommend an area that best suits the criterion of preferences while considering price and location. I am trying to pinpoint the most happening venues around Airbnb listings to understand what locals from that area are into and what possible events they can attend to get a taste of the culture and vibes in a potential vacation spot.**

# Downloading and Prepping Data 
Describe the data that you will be using to solve the problem or execute your idea. Remember that you will need to use the Foursquare location data to solve the problem or execute your idea. You can absolutely use other datasets in combination with the Foursquare location data. So make sure that you provide adequate explanation and discussion, with examples, of the data that you will be using, even if it is only Foursquare location data.

**To provide the stakeholders the necessary information I'll be considering NYC Airbnb data found on Kaggle as well as the foursquare API to extract venues in neighborhoods of interest. These are the two main datasources I will be using to conduct this locational analysis. The Airbnb dataset from Kaggle includes important data points such as price, latitude, longitude, borough and neighborhood. I will use this information to extract venues in these locations from Foursquare and cross reference the top 10 venues.
